# vim-airbnb

## Intro

This is the vim configs for my personal use. It is primarily set up for development of ruby on rails as well as javascripts (including support for React).

## Install

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/xiaoyawei/vim-airbnb.git
cd vim-airbnb
mv .vimrc ~
mv .vim ~
```

You'll also need to install [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for auto-completion.
